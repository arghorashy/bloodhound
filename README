Install node
============
- Use the max node version Firebase will allow.  At the time of writing,
  the command to run is "sudo n 6.11.5".

Connecting to a new Firebase project
====================================
- In the terminal, go to the root of the project and run "firebase init".
- Choose "Hosting".
- When asked what the public directory should be, choose ".".
- When asked whether this should be a single-page website, say yes.
- When asked whether index.js should be overwritten, say no.

Setup firebase authConfig
=========================
- In the root of the project, create authConfig.js.
- Populate it as follows:

const authConfig = {
  apiKey: <api key>,
  authDomain: "<projectID>.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://<projectID>.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "<projectID>",
  storageBucket: "<projectID>.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "745683878285"
};

This is a little circular, but you can find your project ID here:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/<projectID>/settings/general/

"api key" is a jumble of characters that can be found at the link above.
